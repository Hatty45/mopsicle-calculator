# Mopsicle's Calculator

After getting seriously distracted while gaming, this is my first project that I made with C# after switching from C++.

This project was made with WinForms and was my first proper time using it and Visual Studio.





## How to use the calculator

|Button|Function| 
|----|----|
|0-9|Adds the number to the display|
|.|Adds the decimal point (only one)|
|CD|Clears the number display|
|CE|Clears all previous info (operations,numbers,etc.)|
|X, /, +, -|Different operations|
|=|Evaluate the current equasion|
|-/+|Makes the number positive or negative|

## Other info

There are probably many errors in this project - I made it quite quickly and just wanted to get a working demo. The colours are pretty terrible because I am not very good at deciding if they are very good or not. 

I am not very good at keeping a routine of uploading so I will make a video soon (as of 22/05/2025). This is also my first repository.
